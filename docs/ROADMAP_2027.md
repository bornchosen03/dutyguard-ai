# DutyGuard AI — 12-Month “Zero-to-Scale” Roadmap (2027)

This roadmap is designed to help you execute toward a top-tier, AI-based tariff intelligence business by combining:

- Regulatory agility
- Proprietary data + defensible workflows
- High-value service layers (duty drawback, origin optimization, tariff engineering)
- Strong compliance posture (audit trails, human oversight)

> Note: This roadmap is strategic guidance and not legal advice.

## Phase 1 — The Foundation (Months 1–3)

**Goal:** Build the “brain” and prove accuracy. Validate before heavy selling.

### Month 1 — Data aggregation & “the knowledge graph”

**Action:** Ingest the “Big 5” tariff schedules: US (HTSUS), EU (TARIC), China, Japan, and UK.

**Tech tasks:**

- Create a vector database (e.g., Pinecone/Weaviate) containing:
  - Full HS/HTS code tables (current editions)
  - Customs rulings (e.g., CROSS) to teach precedent
  - Legal notes (Section/Chapter notes) that drive classification logic

**Validation target:** 95% accuracy on a “golden set” of 1,000 known complex items.

### Month 2 — The “audit-proof” engine

**Feature build:** Rationale generator.

**Requirement:** Every classification must output a defensible explanation (rule + evidence).

**Compliance:** Align documentation with high-risk system requirements (e.g., EU AI Act) and maintain a human oversight log.

### Month 3 — “De Minimis” alpha

**Target:** High-volume e-commerce shippers.

**Build:** Lightweight API that accepts product URL/price/description and returns a 6-digit HS code fast.

**Why:** This can be the fastest path to revenue in parcel-heavy workflows.

## Phase 2 — Market Entry & First Wedge (Months 4–6)

**Goal:** Secure the first 5 enterprise pilots using a risk-reduced offer.

### Month 4 — Country target: US & Mexico (USMCA)

**Why:** Nearshoring demand makes USMCA compliance high-impact.

**Pitch:** Audit Mexico-to-US shipments; if the client qualified for 0% but paid duty, split the savings.

**Feature:** Certificate of origin / RVC automation for key categories.

### Month 5 — “Duty drawback” hunter

**Action:** Ingest 3 years of client history.

**AI task:** Match import entries to export documents to find refund opportunities.

**Model:** Success fee (e.g., 20%) on recovered drawback funds.

### Month 6 — ERP + commerce integrations

**Build:** Plugins/integrations (e.g., Shopify Plus, Oracle NetSuite).

**Value:** Landed-cost calculation and pricing updates become accurate and fast.

## Phase 3 — Scaling & War Gaming (Months 7–9)

**Goal:** Move from compliance into strategic advantage.

### Month 7 — Vietnam & India expansion

**Feature:** Factory selector.

**Output:** Compare sourcing locations under tariff scenarios and recommend optimal build locations.

### Month 8 — Tariff engineering design studio

**Feature:** Design-time analysis and recommendations that reduce duty exposure.

**Target clients:** Apparel, footwear, and other high-tariff categories.

### Month 9 — Geopolitical “war room” dashboard

**Feature:** Real-time scenario planning.

**Outcome:** Recalculate margins for every SKU under proposed changes and recommend supplier/pricing actions.

## Phase 4 — Domination & Ecosystem (Months 10–12)

**Goal:** Become a system-of-record—“the Bloomberg terminal” of trade intelligence.

### Month 10 — ESG / forced labor “green lane”

**Requirement:** Supplier mapping for multi-tier risk (Tier 2/Tier 3) to reduce seizure/destruction risk.

### Month 11 — API-first headless customs

**Strategy:** White-label the engine to forwarders.

**Model:** Micro-fee per classification at high throughput.

### Month 12 — Autonomous broker workflow

**Milestone:** Partner with, or become, a licensed broker.

**Product:** End-to-end clearing workflows with archiving and audit trails.

## Summary: “Perfect” competitive advantages

- **Pre-computation:** refresh answers nightly as laws change, so answers are instant.
- **The “Why” engine:** every code includes a legal-style rationale + evidence trail.
- **Margin protection:** sell profit impact (saved duty), not just compliance.
- **Shadow mode:** run alongside current broker to prove value quickly.
