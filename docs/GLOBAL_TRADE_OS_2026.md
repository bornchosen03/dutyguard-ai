# DutyGuard AI — Global Trade Operating System (2026)

This page turns the “deep thought” blueprint into clear product direction.

> Note: This is strategic product guidance and not legal advice.

## The positioning

To dominate tariff intelligence, you must move beyond “software” and build a **Global Trade Operating System**—a platform that doesn’t just report changes, but helps clients decide what to do next with evidence, modeling, and audit-ready documentation.

## Blueprint 1: “Molecule‑to‑Margin” engine (chemical & material AI)

**Why it’s a moat:** In highly technical categories (chemicals, materials, pharma, textiles), small specification differences can change classification outcomes and duty exposure.

### The deep mechanics

1) **Ingestion (“lab layer”)**

- Client uploads SDS/CoA PDFs.
- Extract fields like flash point, viscosity, and composition by weight.
- Optional advanced capability: chemical-structure extraction (OCSR) for diagrams.

2) **Logic core (“CAS bridge”)**

- Map names to identifiers (e.g., CAS numbers).
- Link CAS/inputs to duty measures, including anti-dumping where applicable.

3) **Purity algorithm (where savings can appear)**

- Detect threshold-sensitive values.
- Flag when a value is near a cutoff and model the potential classification-sensitive impact.

> Any manufacturing/spec change recommendations must be reviewed by engineering and legal teams.

## Blueprint 2: “War Room” simulator (geopolitical engine)

**Why it sells:** Clients want predictive safety and scenario planning.

### The deep mechanics

1) **Sensor net (global listening)**

- Monitor official registers/journals and announcements frequently.
- Extract risk signals for targeted sectors.

2) **Digital twin simulation**

- Build a virtual representation of the client’s supply chain.
- Run “what-if” scenarios and recalculate total landed cost across every SKU/part.

3) **Ghost sourcing agent**

- When a critical alert triggers, identify alternative suppliers in safer jurisdictions.
- Provide a short list and next actions (request quote, validate lead time, confirm origin proof).

## Blueprint 3: The “insurance moat” (risk coverage)

**The wedge:** CFOs care about liability more than “accuracy percent.”

A premium offering can pair:

- Audit-ready trails (evidence + rationale)
- Human oversight logs
- Contract-based coverage via a third-party Errors & Omissions policy

> Any “guarantee” must be scoped, contract-based, and underwritten. Never market a blanket promise without legal backing.

## The green future: CBAM (carbon as a tariff-like cost)

By 2027, carbon-related adjustments (e.g., CBAM) become a major cost driver.

A “carbon agent” can:

- Ingest emissions factors from suppliers
- Model carbon tax exposure
- Recommend lower-emission sourcing options

## First 90 days execution checklist

1) **Pick a niche** first (chemicals or auto parts are high-pain, high-value).
2) **Use licensed sources** for restricted materials; don’t scrape.
3) Build a free “**Tariff Auditor**” hook:
   - Client uploads last year’s spreadsheets
   - You return an overpayment/opportunity report
   - Convert to paid engagement for recovery + ongoing prevention
