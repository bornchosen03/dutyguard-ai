# DutyGuard AI — Client Guide

This guide explains how tariffs impact your business, how AI helps, and what we need from you to find and recover money.

## How tariffs impact businesses

Tariffs can affect supply chains, investment, and a firm’s input costs. These can create supply-side effects (such as higher prices and operational pressure) and demand-side effects (weaker spending, lower orders).

## What we build (not just a tariff table)

To identify and optimize tariffs using AI, we aren’t just looking for numbers in a table—we’re building an **Automated Trade Compliance & Intelligence Engine**.

Companies use AI to navigate the **Harmonized System (HS) codes**—the international language of trade—where a single digit error can lead to fines, delays, or overpaid taxes.

## How AI finds and analyzes tariffs

### 1) Classification (the HS code engine)

The core of tariff calculation is the HS code. AI can use:

- **NLP** to read product descriptions and technical specs.
- **Multi-modal extraction** when images/photos are available.
- **Fuzzy matching** to map unusual language to known categories.
- **Contextual logic** to distinguish similar items used in different industries.

### 2) Regulatory monitoring

Automated monitors can scan official bulletins, customs sites, and announcements to detect changes quickly.

### 3) Total landed cost

AI doesn’t just find the tariff—it helps model **total landed cost**:

```
Total Landed Cost = Product Price + Insurance + Freight + Customs Duty + Anti-Dumping Fees + VAT
```

## Key features that make a “perfect” platform (2026)

- **Origin optimizer (Rules of Origin):** Analyze bills of materials (BOM) vs FTA rules to identify 0% opportunities and missing proof.
- **Duty drawback discovery:** Match imports with exports to locate refunds.
- **Predictive risk scoring:** Stress-test data against audit/seizure patterns.
- **Tariff engineering:** Suggest design/classification changes that can reduce duty.

## What we need from your company

To locate tariff exposure and maximize recovery, we typically request:

- Entry/shipment data (entry summaries, invoices, packing lists)
- Broker records (statements, duty/tax payments, amendments)
- Product details (descriptions, specs, materials, use-case, photos if available)
- Supplier + country of origin documentation
- HTS codes used historically
- Time window (which months/years to audit)

## Fees

The industry standard is a **Contingency Fee ranging from 15% to 30% of the recovered funds**.
